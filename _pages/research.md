<details> <summary> <i>Local Effects of Bypassing Zoning Regulations in High-Income Areas</i>, with <a href="[https://Example.com](https://noemiesportiche.netlify.app/)"><mark class="color:blue;">Noémie Sportiche</p></mark> </summary> <sub> An increasing number of jurisdictions are passing regulations to allow for denser housing in high-income areas. This paper examines how local house prices and existing residents -who are often strongly opposed to these policies- react to this new construction. We focus on housing constructed under Chapter 40B, a Massachusetts state policy that requires all municipalities to maintain a minimum proportion of affordable housing and allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations if those minimums are not met. Using a difference-in-differences design that compares housing located near 40B developments to housing located slightly farther away paired with rich individual-level data, we provide two sets of results. First, large 40B developments lead to substantial decreases in nearby house prices, while smaller developments do not affect prices. Second, nearby residents respond by moving out at higher rates after large 40B developments are constructed, although we do not observe significant changes in existing residents’ political participation at the state or federal level. </sub> </details>

*Redistribution through Housing Assistance*, with [Juliette Fournier](https://juliettefournier.site/)  <br> <sub>We examine the distributional implications of the shift from public housing to subsidized private housing initiated by the U.S. government over the past few decades. We build a quantitative urban framework where housing assistance complements income taxation to redistribute across workers. We argue that provision of affordable housing involves a trade-off between indirect pecuniary redistribution and direct amenity spin-offs. On the one hand, public housing drives local rents down, while amplifying the spatial concentration of poverty. On the other hand, project- and tenant-based rental assistance enhances the local amenities of subsidized households by promoting mixed-income communities, but pushes private landowners’ rents up. </sub>
