\footnotesize{We revisit recent evidence by Kremer, Willis, and You (2021) suggesting that the lack of economic convergence in early years has now been replaced by modest convergence. We show theoretically and empirically that failure to include country fixed effects will create a bias in convergence coefficients toward zero and this bias can be time varying, even when the underlying country-level parameters are stable. Our reanalysis finds no evidence of major changes in patterns of convergence and, more importantly, no flattening of the relationship between institutional variables and economic growth.

 \textbf{The Weak State Trap} (with Leopoldo Fergusson and James Robinson, 2021). \textit{Economica}, v. 89 Issue 354.

\footnotesize{Development outcomes come in ‘clusters’ that seem difficult to exit. Typically juxtapositioned are states that are both weak in the sense of lacking fiscal resources, but also patrimonial or clientelistic in the way in which they operate. We document the individual behaviour underlying such a cluster using original data from Colombia. We show that tax evasion, as a measure of state weakness, and vote buying, as a measure of clientelism, are highly correlated at the individual level. We argue that while state weakness creates the right environment for clientelism to flourish, clientelism sets in place a structure of incentives for politicians and citizens that is detrimental to building state capacity. We also document that both practices are widely accepted in society, a result consistent with a deeply entrenched relationship of mutually reinforcing influences. Finally, we present evidence of a vector of other types of behaviour and beliefs that are highly correlated with both clientelism and tax evasion, which suggest the presence of multiple feedback loops that we argue justifies calling this situation a trap.} \\

 \textbf{Consumers as VAT ``Evaders'': Incidence, Social Bias, and Correlates in Colombia} (with Leopoldo Fergusson and Juan Felipe Ria\~{n}o, 2019).  \textit{Economia}, v. 19(2). 

\footnotesize{
Tax evasion lies at the core of the relationship between citizens and the state: it reflects the level of trust in the state and compliance with society’s implicit social contract. How- ever, empirically analyzing tax evasion is challenging, particularly because there are few direct and reliable measures. We conduct list experiments on a large sample of households to estimate how frequently consumers are willing to be complicit in value added tax (VAT) evasion, as well as the extent of social desirability bias in respondent answers. Around 20 percent of respondents agree to make purchases without a receipt in order to avoid paying VAT; surprisingly, they are not ashamed to admit this openly. Evasion is more prevalent in places with more informality and less physical presence of the state, as well as among poorer, less educated individuals and those who disregard the rule of law.

\textbf{I Sell My Vote, and So What? Incidence, Social Bias, and Correlates of Clientelism in Colombia} (with Leopoldo Fergusson and Juan Felipe Ria\~{n}o, 2018). \textit{Economia}, v. 19(1).

\footnotesize{
Exchanging one’s vote for particularistic benefits—practices usually grouped under clientelism—is often thought to weaken programmatic links between citizens and politicians and disincentivize public good provision, as well as undermine voter autonomy and the ideal role of elections. However, empirically analyzing this key phenomenon for the working of democracies entails formidable challenges. We conduct list experiments on a large sample of households to estimate the incidence of clientelistic vote buying, as well as the extent to which respondents refrain from openly recognizing this behavior. Nearly one out of every five respondents engage in clientelism, and, surprisingly, they do not feel ashamed to admit it. Guided by the existing literature and systematically verifying the sensitivity of the results to model specification, we examine the robust correlates of clientelism and discuss the implications of our key findings}\\

<details> <summary> <i>Local Effects of Bypassing Zoning Regulations in High-Income Areas</i>, with <a href="[https://Example.com](https://noemiesportiche.netlify.app/)"><mark class="color:blue;">Noémie Sportiche</p></mark> </summary> <sub> An increasing number of jurisdictions are passing regulations to allow for denser housing in high-income areas. This paper examines how local house prices and existing residents -who are often strongly opposed to these policies- react to this new construction. We focus on housing constructed under Chapter 40B, a Massachusetts state policy that requires all municipalities to maintain a minimum proportion of affordable housing and allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations if those minimums are not met. Using a difference-in-differences design that compares housing located near 40B developments to housing located slightly farther away paired with rich individual-level data, we provide two sets of results. First, large 40B developments lead to substantial decreases in nearby house prices, while smaller developments do not affect prices. Second, nearby residents respond by moving out at higher rates after large 40B developments are constructed, although we do not observe significant changes in existing residents’ political participation at the state or federal level. </sub> </details>

*Redistribution through Housing Assistance*, with [Juliette Fournier](https://juliettefournier.site/)  <br> <sub>We examine the distributional implications of the shift from public housing to subsidized private housing initiated by the U.S. government over the past few decades. We build a quantitative urban framework where housing assistance complements income taxation to redistribute across workers. We argue that provision of affordable housing involves a trade-off between indirect pecuniary redistribution and direct amenity spin-offs. On the one hand, public housing drives local rents down, while amplifying the spatial concentration of poverty. On the other hand, project- and tenant-based rental assistance enhances the local amenities of subsidized households by promoting mixed-income communities, but pushes private landowners’ rents up. </sub>
