I graduated with a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2022. Previously, I earned a M.S. in Economics from the Barcelona School of Economics in 2016 and a B.S. in Economics and Laws from Universitat Pompeu Fabra in 2015.

In summer 2023, I will join the Department of Economics at Rutgers University as an Assistant Professor.
